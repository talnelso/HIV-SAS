** Created by Tammie L. Nelson on 2021-11-21 ;
** Purpose: To call in eHARS formats. ;
** Revisions: ;
** Production schedule: None ;
** Limitations and Wa-rnings:
	1)	Formats are subject to change without notice. If eHARS processing program fails to run, or runs
		with errors or warnings, look for most recent eHARS technical guide and/or contact MCPHD or IDOH for
		guidance on any changes to the CDC database. ;
** Program Flow ;
**  1) Create eHARS formats ;
